The best and only way to go through games on Steam is going through the entire data base. 
Sort them by date of release, or alphabetical,
Hide ignored items
Hide items in my library
Hide items on my watchlist
Games
then make sure no other filters are checked, and start ignoring every single game you don't want nor want to be shown. It's time consuming, but you will filter out a lot of crap. I do it while watching/listening to something. If there is an upper limit to the ignore list I haven't reached it yet. 128,000+
